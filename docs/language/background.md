FlowLog builds on the VLDB 2026 paper:

> **FlowLog: Efficient and Extensible Datalog via Incrementality**  \
> Hangdong Zhao, Zhenghong Yu, Srinag Rao, Simon Frisk, Zhiwei Fan, Paraschos Koutris  \
> Boston, VLDB 2026 — [arXiv 2511.00865](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00865)

Earlier work, tutorials, and reference implementations from FlowLog continue to inform this project. Many thanks to [Hangdong Zhao](https://github.com/hdz284) and contributors for their ongoing support.
