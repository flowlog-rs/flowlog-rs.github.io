FlowLog is a composable Datalog-to-Rust pipeline for building scalable Differential Dataflow programs. Use this tutorial to move from environment setup through language internals.

## Start Here

1. [Set up the environment](getting-started/environment) and [build the workspace](getting-started/build).
2. Review the [architecture](getting-started/architecture) and [generator CLI](getting-started/generator-cli).
3. Walk through the [end-to-end example](tutorial/end-to-end) and [regression harness](tutorial/regression-harness).
4. Dive into the [language overview](language/overview) and [current limitations](language/limitations).

FlowLog accepts a Soufflé-compatible Datalog dialect with modules for recursion, negation, arithmetic, and aggregations.
